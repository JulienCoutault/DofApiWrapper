# DofApiWrapper

A php wrapper to use [DofApi](https://github.com/dofapi)

## Requirements

You need `php-curl`

## Use

See into folder examples

Almost routes works except
```
/equipements/{id}/set
/sets/{id}/equipements
/sets/{id}/weapon
/weapons/{id}/set
```
These routes are a little complique to set beautifilly and i prefere wait new version of api to set all routes.

If you need these route open an issue or a pull request.
